# Kanban-Board
The purpose is to build a Kanban Board app for product development 



# Description
The purpose of this project was to create a popular project management app "kanban." This will help organize individual or group projects. Adding JSON Web Token allow me secure the frontend of the app. This will ensure users are logged in before gaining access to the app. 

## Challenge
This challenge help me understand more about how important it is to utilize authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This help avoid anyone from gaining access to your application without being authorized. My biggest challenge is when you first open the page, the logout button show at the top instead of the login page. I spent hours trying to figure out why but could not come up with a solution. As a result, users would have to click on logout and then they will be directed to login and gain access to the Kanban features. I look forward to coming back to this app and fixing this issue.
